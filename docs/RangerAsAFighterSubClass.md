## Favoured Enemy
Beginning at 3rd levei, you have significant experience
studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain
type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations,
beasts, celestiais, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey,
fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid
(such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to
track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence
checks to recall information about them.
When you gain this feature, you also learn one
language of your choice that is spoken by your favored
enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as
an associated language, at 15th level. As you
gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

## Natural Explorer
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural
environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in
such regions.

Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic,
coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp,
or the Underdark. 

When you make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that
you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored
terrain, you gain the following benefits:

- Difticult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can't become lost except by magical
means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while
traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking),
you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at
a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you
normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their
exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they
passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 7th
and 10th level.

## Greater Favoured Enemy
At 7th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game.

Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants.

You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4. 

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

## Iron Mind
At 10th level, you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

## Stalker's Fury
Starting at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you miss with ana ttack, you can make another attack.

## Feral Slayer
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help
you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a
creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't
impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible
creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the
creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't
blinded or deafened.

You also become an unparalleled hunter of your
enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your
Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.
You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
