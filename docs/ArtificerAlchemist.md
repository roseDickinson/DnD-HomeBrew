# Alchemist

This subclass is modified slightly from the Artificer Unearthed Arcana, to provide a more fun (in my opinion) and flavourful Alchemist subclass.

## Alchemical Formulae

At 3rd level you learn four Alchemical Formula options: Alchemical Fire, Alchemical Acid and two other options of your choice. You learn an additional formula of your choice at 5th, 9th, 17th.

To use any of these options you must spend some time after a long rest preparing your formulae for the day. You can prepare a number of formula equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Artificer Level. Once you have prepared your formula they must be stored in your Alchemist's Satchel. Any formulae that are unused the next time you long rest are lost and you must prepare a new batch.

If an Alchemical Formula requires a saving throw the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.Â 

### Alchemical Fire

As an action you can reach into your Alchemist's satchel, pull out a vial of volatile liquid and hurl the vial at a creature, object or surface within 30 feet of you. On impact, the vial detonates in a 5ft radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage.

This formula's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (3d6), 9th level (4d6), 13th level (5d6), 15th level (6d6), 17th level (7d6), 19th level (8d6).

### Alchemical Acid

As an action you can reach into your Alchemist's satchel, pull out a vial of acid, and hurl the vial at a creature or object within 30 feet of you. The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximised.

This formula's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (4d6), 7th level(5d6), 9th level (6d6), 13th level (7d6), 15th level (8d6), 17th level (9d6), 19th level (10d6).

### Healing Draught

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a vial of healing liquid. A creature can drink it as an action to regain 2d8 hit points. The vial then disappears. Once a creature regains hit points from this alchemical formula, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest. If not used the vial and its contents disappear after 1 hour. While the vial exists you can't use this formula again.

This formula's healing increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (3d8), 7th level(4d8), 9th level (5d8), 11th level (6d8), 13th level (7d8), 15th level (8d8), 17th level (9d8), 19th level (10d8).

### Smoke Stick

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a stick that produces a thick plume of smoke. You can hold on to the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as part of the action used to produce it. The area in a 10 foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear. After using this formula you can't do so again for 1 minute.

### Swift Step Draught

As a bonus action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a vial filled with a bubbling, brown, liquid. As an action, a creature can drink it. Doing so increases the creature's speed by 20 feet for 1 minute, and the vial disappears. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 minute. After using this formula you can't do so again for 1 minute.

### Tanglefoot Bag

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a bag filled with writhing, sticky black tar and hurl it at a point within 30 feet of you. The bag bursts on impact and covers the ground in a 5 foot radius with sticky goo. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that starts its turn on the ground in that area has its speed halved for that turn. After using this formula you can't do so again for 1 minute.

### Thunderstone

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a crystalline shard and hurl it at a creature, object or surface within 30 feet of you. The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point.
